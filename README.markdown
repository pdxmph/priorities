# Priorities

`priorities` is a simple tool meant to help you follow a
prioritization exercise that goes something like this:

1. Get all the stuff your team is doing out of your head and into a
list.
2. Prioritize everything using a simple scale (0 = none, 3 = high)
3. Describe how much effort you're putting toward everything (0 =
none, 3 = lots)
4. Look for disconnects between your stated priorities and the work
your team is actually doing.
5. Have a conversation with your team and your manager.

You can read more about this process and my thinking around it here:

`priorities` is a pared-down version of my
[Docs Decomposer][decomposer], which has the same tool, only hardcoded
for a team of tech writers, and without any conception of multiple
teams.
